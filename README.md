# English-To-Number-Converter
This Python program converts numbers written in English words (e.g., "two thousand five hundred thirty six") into numeric integers (2536). It supports numbers up to thousands, handles compound words, correctly processes multipliers like hundred and thousand, and uses a dictionary to map words to values for accurate calculation.
